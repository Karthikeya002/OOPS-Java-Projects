3. **Shape Calculator** - Illustrates abstraction and interfaces
4. **Employee Management** - Complex encapsulation and data hiding
5. **Library System** - Demonstrates relationships between classes
6. **Vehicle Rental** - Shows polymorphism and inheritance
7. **Student Grade System** - Uses encapsulation and composition
8. **Banking ATM System** - Implements complete OOPS concepts
9. **Game Characters** - Demonstrates inheritance hierarchies
10. **E-Commerce System** - Shows real-world OOPS implementation
